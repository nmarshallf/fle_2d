## Usage

Given an image represented by a 2D array of size LxL that you want to expand into the disk harmonic basis, first create a basis object by calling
```python
from fle_2d import FLEBasis2D
L = 128         #replace this by the side-length of your image
bandlimit = L   #maximum number of basis functions to use
eps = 1e-7      #desired accuracy
fle = FLEBasis2D(L, bandlimit, eps)
```
Here, eps is the accuracy desired in applying the basis expansion, corresponding to the epsilon in Theorem 4.1 in the paper. "Bandlimit" is a parameter that determines how many basis functions to use and corresponds to the variable lambda in equation (5.1) in the paper, scaled so that L is the maximum suggested.

All arguments to FLEBasis2D:

- L:    size of image to be expanded

- bandlimit:    bandlimit parameter (scaled so that L is max suggested)

- eps:     requested relative precision

- maxitr:      maximum number of iterations for the expand method (if not specified, pre-tuned values are used)

- maxfun:      maximum number of basis functions to use (if not specified, which is the default, the number implied by the choice of bandlimit is used)


- mode:       choose either "real" or "complex" (default) output, using either real-valued or complex-valued basis functions


    
To go from the image to the basis coefficients, you would then call either

```python
coeff = fle.evaluate_t(image)
```

which applies the operator $\tilde{B}^*$ in Theorem 4.1 of the paper, or 

```python
coeff = fle.expand(image)
```
which solves a least squares problem instead of just applying equation $\tilde{B}^*$ once. The latter can be more accurate, but takes a bit longer since it applies evaluate_t ```maxitr``` times using Richardson iteration.

Once you have coefficients ```coeff``` in the basis, you can evaluate the corresponding function with expansion coefficients ```coeff``` on the LxL grid by running

```python
image = fle.evaluate(coeff)
```

which corresponds to applying the operator $\tilde{B}$ in Theorem 4.1 in the paper.
